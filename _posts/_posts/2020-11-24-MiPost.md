I should have known better
Than to let you go alone
It's times like these
I can't make it on my own
Wasted days and sleepless nights
And I can't wait to see you again

I find I spend my time
Waiting on your call
How can I tell you, babe
My back's against the wall
I need you by my side
To tell me it's alright
'Cause I don't think I can take anymore
